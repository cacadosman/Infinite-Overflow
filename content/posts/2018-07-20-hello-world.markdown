Hi, Welcome to My Blog.
I’m just an ordinary student from Gadjah Mada University, focusing in Computer Science Major. Love coding and all about technology, especially in Web Development, Backend, and Cyber Security.

This blog is absolutely meaningless, i just love to write what i like. Maybe i’ll write some tutorials for you or something else that i don’t know why i write that :”(
